# CMIP6cex
The repository provides several functionalities to derive CMIP6 data at reduced grids or at a list of tide gauge coordinates from raw CMIP6 data, using packages like intake-esm and xmip. Regression coefficients based on the multi-linear regression model of Tadesse et al. (2020, 2021) are used to estimate storm surges from the daily mean atmospheric simulations of CMIP6 models.

Several scripts are provided to analyze (changes in) the number of compound (joint) extreme events simulated by the CMIP6 models.
